- The flowers of Osmanthus fragrans may be white through yellow to orange. Visually rather insignificant, they have superb fragrance. 

There are about 30 species of Osmanthus, mostly occurring in subtropical eastern Asia, though one or two species are found in North America (Wallander & Albert 2000). They are evergreen shrubs or small trees with simple, opposite leaves. The leaves are glabrous, entire, serrated or spiny and often covered with glands. Inflorescences are terminal or axillary panicles or fascicled cymes. The flowers are hermaphrodite, though usually becoming unisexual, and the plants are subsequently dioecious or androdioecious. The calyx is four-lobed and campanulate; the corolla is four-lobed, white or yellow and campanulate or tubular; the lobes are imbricate, obtuse and often reflexed; stamens two (to four). The fruit is a drupe with a hard or bony endocarp (Green 1958, Grohmann 1974, Chang et al. 1996).

The genus Osmanthus is most familiar in the form of several bushy evergreen shrubs or small trees that bear fragrant white flowers, sometimes in great profusion (for example, O. delavayi), or add foliage interest to the garden (for example, O. heterophyllus). Despite their being usually treated as shrubs it seems that many species are in fact capable of becoming broad-crowned small trees – although this may require warmer conditions than experienced in northern European gardens. Several species described in Flora of China have not yet been introduced to cultivation and could be looked for by collectors. Osmanthus are easily propagated by cuttings rooted in warmth in summer, or by seed, although this is not often produced in cultivation.

- A small group of evergreen shrubs and small or medium-sized trees. Two species (perhaps reducible to one) inhabit the southern USA, the rest are from Asia and the Pacific region. The cultivated species are from China and Japan, but one, O. decora, is from western Asia. They are closely akin to the olive (Olea), and have opposite leaves. Flowers white or yellowish, sometimes unisexual, in small axillary or terminal clusters. Calyx and corolla four-lobed; stamens two. Fruit an oval drupe, usually dark blue or violet. In O. americanus and the other American species, not treated here, the inflorescence is paniculate.

These shrubs are handsome evergreens with a holly-like appearance. They are sometimes propagated by grafting on privet – an undesirable method, for they are healthier and better on their own roots. Cuttings taken about the end of July strike readily if given a little bottom heat. They grow well in any good garden soil, and have no objection to chalk.

### 汤圆

- 汤圆，别称“汤团”“浮元子”，是汉族传统小吃的代表之一 。同时，也是元宵节最具有特色的食物，历史十分悠久。
据传，汤圆起源于宋朝。当时明州（现浙江省宁波市）兴起吃一种新奇食品，即用黑芝麻、猪油做馅、加入少许白砂糖，外面用糯米粉搓成圆形，煮熟后，吃起来香甜可口，饶有风趣。因为这种糯米汤圆煮在锅里又浮又沉，所以它最早叫“浮元子”，后来有的地区把“浮元子”改称汤圆。然而，汤圆象征合家团圆更美好，吃汤圆意味新的一年合家幸福、团团圆圆，所以是正月十五元宵节必备美食。而在南方某些地区，人们在春节的时候也会习惯吃汤圆，而不是饺子。

  汤圆含糖特别高，而太甜的食物会影响脾胃。中医说“甘入脾”，味甘的食物如汤圆，有“缓滞”作用，适量摄取能为肠胃带来能量，帮助消化吸收吃进肚子里的食物，但是吃多了则会减缓肠胃蠕动，导致打嗝、胀气、腹泻、食欲不振、消化不良等消化道症状。因此，在吃汤圆的同时，可以搭配一些辛味的食物，如葱、姜、蒜、辣椒等，来平衡汤圆带来的滞缓效果，减低对脾胃的伤害。所以吃汤圆最好搭配一些小菜，比如蒜泥茄子、洋葱拌木耳等，不仅爽口解腻，营养也更均衡。
汤圆还有一种很好的搭配方法，就是米酒，叫米酒汤圆，米酒俗称醪糟，使用糯米蒸熟后加入酒精发酵而成的，酒精度数不高，味道香甜可口，用来做小汤圆，可以刺激消化腺分泌增进食欲，而却对产妇还有催乳的功能。

- 南方汤圆
吃汤圆是汉族人的传统习俗，在江南尤为盛行。民间有“吃了汤圆大一岁”之说。陈志岁《汤圆》诗云：“年年冬至家家煮，一岁潜添晓得无？” 甬地俗语云：“宁波家家捣米做汤圆，知足常乐又一天。”胡秉言也有诗曰：“香泽糯米做汤圆，沸水飘银富贵咸。入口绵甜滑润爽，阖家欢乐醉天年。”“宁波汤圆”是必备的食品，是一种用糯米粉制成的圆形甜品，“圆”意味着“团圆”“圆满”，节庆时间吃汤圆，象征家庭和谐、吉祥，故至汤圆又叫“浮元子”。
正月十五元宵节，“宁波汤圆”作为食品，在我国也由来已久。这种食品，最早叫“浮元子”后称“汤圆”，又称元宵；“汤圆”以芝麻、豆沙、核桃仁、果仁、枣泥等为馅料，用糯米粉包成圆形，可荤可素，风味各异。可汤煮、油炸、蒸食，有团圆美满之意。

- 北方元宵
北方元宵，是以馅为基础，江米面粉为外立面的制作工序。过程简单易学：先拌馅料，和匀后摊成大圆薄片，晾凉后再切成比乒乓球大小的立方块。然后把馅块放入簸箕里，倒上适量江米粉，摇晃中就“筛”起来了。随着馅料在互相撞击中变成球状，江米也沾到馅料表面形成了元宵。做成的元宵江米粉层很薄、表面是干的，下锅煮时江米粉才吸收水份变糊
